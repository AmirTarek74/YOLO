# YOLO Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image in a single pass through a convolutional neural network.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: YOLO can detect objects in images and videos in real-time, making it suitable for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.
- **Single Pass Inference**: Unlike traditional object detection methods, YOLO performs detection in a single pass through the network, leading to faster inference times.
- **Bounding Box Prediction**: YOLO predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object detected, providing precise localization and classification.

- **Easy to Use**: The repository provides scripts and utilities for training the model on custom datasets, performing inference on images  and handling data preprocessing.
- **Compatibility**: The implementation is compatible with popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
